Geller asserts between second cent. BCE and up to early fourth cent.

#### Egypt
An important note about the Hellenistic educational demotic content is that is is largely unpublished, according to Cribiore 2001. It is possible that more has been published since then, but I am also struggling to find more content. Nonetheless, Cribiore does say that the interaction between Greek and Demotic educational practices deserves further study.[^1]

| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Zenon Archive](posts/Zenon-Archive.md)             | Approx. 263-229 BCE | Nicely situation time-wise, but educational content is more sparse |
| [Elephantine Ostraca](posts/Elephantine-Ostraca.md) | Varied. From Pre-Ptolemaic to Imperial | Not many school texts/exercises. 11 in Total. Perhaps worth looking into the contents of the rest which may refer to education (roughly 650 total in the whole corpus)                                                                    |
| [Katochoi Archive](posts/Katochoi-Archive.md)        | Approx. 199-150 BCE | Nicely situated time-wise, but perhaps only useful for understanding the outcome of education since the katochoi ocassionally demonstrate knowledge of literature                                                                   |
| [Narmouthis Ostraca](posts/Narmouthis-Ostraca.md) | Approx. 150-225 CE  | Perhaps a bit too far outside the Hellenistic period, but the amount of educational ostraca (approx. 1400) makes it valuable |                                              |                     |                                                                    |
