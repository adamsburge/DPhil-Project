#### Egypt
An important note about the Hellenistic educational demotic content is that is is largely unpublished, according to Cribiore 2001. It is possible that more has been published since then, but I am also struggling to find more content. Nonetheless, Cribiore does say that the interaction between Greek and Demotic educational practices deserves further study.[^1]

| [Elephantine Ostraca](posts/Elephantine-Ostraca.md) | Varied. From Pre-Ptolemaic to Imperial | Not many school texts/exercises. 11 in Total.

| [Katochoi Archive](posts/Katochoi-Archive.md)        | Approx. 199-150 BCE | Nicely situated time-wise, but perhaps only useful for understanding the outcome of education since the katochoi ocassionally demonstrate knowledge of literature                                                                   |
| [Narmouthis Ostraca](posts/Narmouthis-Ostraca.md) | Approx. 150-225 CE  | Perhaps a bit too far outside the Hellenistic period, but the amount of educational ostraca (approx. 1400) makes it valuable |                                              |                     |                                                                    |

##### Cuneiform

- [[Herman Vanstiphout]]
- [[Åke Sjöberg]]
- [[Dominique Charpin]]: especially 1989.
- [[Igor Diakonov]]: especially 1990. Keep in mind that this is in Russian. [[Niek Veldhuis]] give a good summary, though. (pp.26ff.)
- [[Eleanor Robson]]
- [[Wilfred van Soldt]] (particularly his edited volume with Wolfert van Egmond 2012)

##### Other
- Pierre Bourdieu (Sociologist; originator of the term 'rite of institution'. Griffiths prefers Bourdieu's term over Van Gennep's when it comes to articulating ancient education)
- Arnold Van Gennep (Anthropology of Religion; originator of the term 'rite of passage'. Could be worth looking into how he conceptualises it and how it has been critiqued by modern scholars, especially as it pertains to education)
