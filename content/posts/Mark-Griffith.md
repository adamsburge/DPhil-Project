## Brief Bio
Mark Griffith is the Klio Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Classical Languages and Literature at University of California, Berkeley. His research interests are in Classical drama and performance, Greek and Latin literature, and Ancient Greek music. He received a Ph.D. in Classics from Cambridge in 1973.

## Notable Publications
- Griffith, M. (2015) 'Origins and Relations to the Near East' in Bloomer, W. M. (ed.) *[A Companion to Ancient Education](A-Companion-to-Ancient-Education.md)*. Chichester: Wiley Blackwell. 
- Griffith, M. (2015) '[The Earliest Greek Systems of Education](The-Earliest-Greek-Systems-of-Education-Reading-Notes-Griffith.md)' in Bloomer, W. M. (ed.) *[A Companion to Ancient Education](A-Companion-to-Ancient-Education.md)*. Chichester: Wiley Blackwell. 

## My Opinions
So far, Bloomer has both impressed and disappointed me. He seems to be much more knowledgeable on Early and Classical Greek (primarily Athenian) education and his chapter on this ([The Earliest Greek Systems of Education](The-Earliest-Greek-Systems-of-Education-Reading-Notes-Griffith.md)) was very informative. When he branches out to Ancient Near Eastern education, however, his coverage is sparse and he provides little more than what could be gathered from Wikipedia.
