### Wednesday 24 November 2021
#### New Content
- These notes are now available online!
- Occurrences of the word παιδεία in papyri added to the [παιδεία lemma-profile](παιδεία.md)
- Beginning work on the words [μάθησις](μάθησις.md) and [δίδαξις](δίδαξις.md)
- Many new words under the [Greek section "Words Not Yet Categorised"](../_index.md#Greek%20Words)

#### Overview of What I've Worked On
I began looking into how the words μάθησις and δίδαξις are spread out over time. After realising that these, like παιδεία, are much more focused in Late Antiquity, I began looking to see if there are words related to ancient education which are, time-wise, more prominent 

#### Thoughts on Where I'm at and What I'm Doing


#### Questions
- I'm finding that many of these words that relate to education occur much more (usually at least 8-10 times more) in late antiquity than in the Hellenistic era. Do you think it would be worth my time to investigate late antique education to see if it could shed any light on the Hellenistic era, educational practices in antiquity or both? I'm not very familiar with late antiquity and so it would be a bit more foreign to me. Though, if it is likely to yield useful information, I'm definitely willing to look into it.
