### Wednesday 17 (24?) November 2021
#### Updates
- These notes are now available online!
- Occurrences of the word παιδεία in papyri added to the [παιδεία lemma-profile](παιδεία.md)
- Beginnig work on the words [μάθησις](μάθησις.md) and [δίδαξις](δίδαξις.md)

#### Questions
- I'm finding that many of these words that relate to education occur much more (usually at least 8-10 times more) in late antiquity than in the Hellenistic era. Do you think it would be worth my time to investigate late antique education to see if it could shed any light on the Hellenistic era, educational practices in antiquity or both?
