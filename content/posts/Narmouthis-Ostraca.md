## Description
Perhaps the largest corpus of Demotic and Greek educational material, this corpus includes 600 entirely Demotic, 350 Demotic-Greek, 70 Greek-Demotic all of which appears to be from a school in Narmouthis.


## Secondary Literature
- [Cribiore, R.](Raffaella-Cribiore.md) (2001) _[Gymnastics of the Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt](Gymnastics-of-the-Mind-Greek-Education-in-Hellenistic-and-Roman-Egypt.md)_. Princeton: Princeton University Press.
	- Briefly mentions the Narmouthis Ostraca on page 22, though does not provide much of an investigation since Cribiore's focus is on Greek education.
