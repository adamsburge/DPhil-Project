## Reading Notes
#### 1. General Issues: Minoans, Mycenaeans, and the Earliest “Greeks”

> *Page [26]:* Once developed, the Classical Greek and Roman program of rhetorically oriented education, with its regularized techniques of instruction and clearly articulated philosophy and goals, possessed a remarkable uniformity and continuity, and we can chart in some detail the processes of its increasing systematization and homogenization, from the later fifth century into the ripe Hellenistic system and beyond.

- *My note [26]:* I really like the phrase ‘rhetorically-oriented’. It may be a useful term for distinguishing Greek education from others. Though, it does seem here that Griffith is subtly indicating that other cultures’ education systems were not regularised, did not have clearly articulated goals, nor did they possess a uniformity and continuity. It’s possible that he did not mean this, but his phrasing has a slight undertone of Hellenocentricism that makes inferences made from his phrasing misleading.

  

#### 2. Minoans and Mycenaeans

> *Page [28]:* We may assume that in most cases, as in the Mesopotamian scribal system (see Chapter 1), they trained their own children in their craft, on the job, though some of these “children” of master craftsmen were adopted or immigrant apprentices who were sent to them specifically to learn their trade (Chadwick 1976: 135–158; Killen 1964: 1–16; Bloedow 1997: 439–447; in general Aegaeum 16: 1997).

- *My note [28]:* What does ‘We may assume’ mean? Is there evidence for this or is it conjectural? I’m not exactly impressed with this phrasing as it is imprecise and leaves the reader to determine its meaning.

  

> *Page [29]:* probably the training occurred one-on-one and somewhat informally, focused on the practical record keeping that seems to have been the scribes’ chief duty (compare Veldhuis 2014). Computation was certainly taught as well as writing, and the system of weights and measures in the Linear B records is similar to that found at Ugarit and elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean (Vermeule 1972; Alberti et al. 2006).

- *My note [29]:* This gets at one of the things I’m trying to figure out for Hellenistic education. What exactly is included in education? Is it just literacy? Or is computation included? If either is included or excluded, does that indicate something about the intended outcome of the education?

  

#### 3. Archaic Greece

> *Page [33]:* the Classical (rhetoric-based) educational system in the midfifth century bce

- *My note [33]:* Again, I’m wondering whether there are other rhetoric-based education systems outside Greece. This is definitely something to look into as it could be a defining difference if it turns out to be the case. Griffith seems to think it is the feature that distinguishes Classical Greek education (and onwards, I assume) from everything outside Greece and before the Classical era.

  

> *Page [33]:* By the seventh century at least, and in some cases much earlier, Greek-speaking communities were sprinkled across a wide area, from the Black Sea to Egypt and Libya, and from Cadiz and Marseilles to Cyprus, Syria, and the Ukraine. Among these communities, there was much cultural variation, so we should hardly expect pedagogical practices to have been identical.

- *My note [33]:* Very valid. Though it would be interesting to know if there are are any trends that would help summarize the whole.

  

> *Page [33]:* At its opening, in the ninth through eighth centuries, the “chieftains” or “lords” (basileis) and noble families (agathoi, eupatridai) in each village, region, or larger town, mostly lacked the resources, administrative frameworks, and sophistication of their Bronze Age predecessors and lived at a level of culture barely higher than that of the rest of their agricultural and artisan neighbors.

- *My note [33]:* This is very interesting phrasing. Griffith betrays his own preferences and opinions with the phrase ‘at a level of culture barely higher than that of the rest of..’. This sort of value judgement clearly indicates what Griffith is leading up to being the ultimate form of education and culture (i.e., the Greeks, most likely).

  

> *Page [34]:* But as wealth increased, inequalities of wealth increased, too, and the nobles, like any ruling class, needed to develop an ideological and performative basis for their authority.

- *My note [34]:* Seem a rather obvious oversimplification.

  

> *Page [34]:* Modern scholars have debated the degree to which Archaic Greek communities were organized in general by age groupings and whether or not adolescents of either or both sexes were required to undergo a definitive rite de passage.

- *My note [34]:* The phrase ‘rite de passage’ could be a helpful term to take away. It seem paideia serves almost as a rite of passage in Greek culture (while admittedly also teaching content) whereas more technical education is not so much a rite of passage but a means to social or economic mobility or security. This is just my thoughts at the moment, though. I’m sure it will become more nuanced with time.

  

> *Page [34]:* It is more helpful to think of these Greek processes overall as a series of “rites of institution,” rather than a definitive “rite of passage” (Bourdieu 1991; Griffith 200l; Christesen 2012; etc)

- *My note [34]:* It seems the term ‘rites of institution’ comes from Bourdieu 1991. I honestly don’t know what it is. It may be worth reading the chapter on it in his book to help my understanding of the difference between the two.

  

> *Page [34]:* So, in so far as “education, training” (paideia, agôgê) involved the process of preparing boys and girls for and through successful participation in these various institutions, we may talk of an Archaic Greek educational “system,” even while taking care to specify the several divergent, or even competing, paths that might lie open to them.

- *My note [34]:* This, I think, is a helpful framework/perhaps even a starting point to articulating a definition of education.

  

> *Page [35]:* The case of healers (iatroi) may have been somewhat special, in involving a more specialized training (see Chapter 28). In the Iliad (4.192–219 and 11. 830–832), the Centaur Chiron is mentioned as the teacher not only of Achilles but also of Asclepius, whose sons have inherited their father’s expertise in “gentle remedies” (êpia pharmaka) and the treatment of wounds. According to other traditions, Asclepius acquired his medical expertise directly from his father, Apollo; and associations of Asclepius’ supposed descendants (Asklêpiadai) continue to compile and transmit their knowledge and techniques, and to train their successors, for centuries to come. In the Classical period, the Hippocratic covenant requires a young doctor “to hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to lead my life in partnership with him … and to treat his offspring as equal to my brothers …” (Hipp. Oath 5–7; Edelstein 1967: 40–48; Burkert 1985: 214–215 with Near Eastern parallels). In the Iliad, these techniques include minor surgery and knowledge of painkilling and remedial herbs for application and ingestion, similar to what was taught in the Indic Gurukula (see Chapter 1, pp. 20–21). In certain regions (especially to the north, where Thracian and Scythian contacts were strong), we encounter from at least the sixth century the use of incantation, trance and incubation, root cutting, ingestion of psychotropic plants, and other specialized techniques, including necromancy (Burkert 1992: 55–75).

- *My note [35]:* This picks up on something I’ve been wondering about recently: what role does medicine and medical education play in this? Is it part of this project? Furthermore, what about religion? Is religious education a part of this project?

  

> *Page [35]:* Some of the material may be much older, and particular similarities suggest that there must have been contacts between the folk-medical and professional traditions of the Greeks and those of Egypt and Babylonia (esp. Assyria), where written documentation was extensive, though Greek medicine seems to be distinctive in its attention to diet and in recording detailed case histories.

- *My note [35]:* This is interesting. I think Eckart Frahm discusses the distinct differences between Greek and Mesopotamian medicine at the end of his book on cuneiform commentaries (Frahm 2011: 382).

  

> *Page [36]:* One essential measure of masculine excellence (aretê) was, of course, military achievement, together with prowess at activities of similar kinds such as athletics and hunting.

- *My note [36]:* Again, the question arises for my project: does military education play a role? Is it part of this project? Would it be neglecting some part of ancient education to omit it? Or would it be better to focus more on something more specific (say, education regarding literacy). Not sure yet.

  

> *Page [40]:* Most of the “pedagogical” age groupings that we know about, i.e., those involving extended periods of training and shared activities, were quite selective, distinguishing their members more or less sharply from others to whom such a pedagogy was not granted. Thus, they do not seem to have amounted to a universal initiation rite. Instead, there were several different “rites of institution” (in the terminology of Bourdieu 1991) through which select groups were trained, prepared, and hailed into membership of their particular social classes and adult functions. Some of these institutional processes were compulsory, others voluntary: some not quite either. Some were publicly administered

- *My note [40]:* This paragraph just makes me want to read Bourdieu’s chapter on ‘Rites of Institution’ even more. I don’t know exactly what I’ll find (Griffiths doesn’t explain it in much detail, though he seems to prefer it to Van Gennep’s ‘rite of passage’), but it is bound to useful information helping define education (or just context of how people have defined it).

  

> *Page [41]:* The Earliest Greek Systems of Education 41 (i.e., by the polis and its officials); others privately organized and funded, by families or particular groups (Griffith 2001). Some were restricted to citizens; others were open to a broader cross section of the community.

  

> *Page [41]:* In this chapter, however, we consider only institutionalized groups and types of training for the young that are clearly attested in non-fictionalized accounts. These fall into four main categories: (a) choruses; (b) military commensality (mess halls, etc.= syssition or andreion, including the ephêbeia); (c) drinking clubs (symposion and hetaireia); and (d) schools (didaskaleion). Other religious and craft associations (thiasos or orgeôn) seem not generally to have been organized by age nor to have involved systematic instruction or training (Jones 1999; parker 2005).

- *My note [41]:* Helpful, I suppose.

  

> *Page [41]:* The process of institution thus involved both inclusion and exclusion: as members of a collective “dance-company” (choros), “herd” (agelâ), “club” (hetaireia, sussition), or “formation” (taxis), etc., the young women or young men became homogenized and integrated as “equals” (homoioi, homêlikes), sharing similar costume, hairstyle, performance techniques, and verbal codes, while at the same time differentiating themselves from all others whose age, gender, ethnicity, or social status barred them from membership.

- *My note [41]:* This makes me think about how education, at least in this format, really attempts to unify a people around certain cultural values. Does this happen in technical education? Likely so, but I don’t yet know how.

  

> *Page [42]:* Along with athletics (discussed earlier), the most distinctive feature of Archaic Greek pedagogy was perhaps its emphasis on song, poetry, and dance, which were all conventionally regarded as sponsored by the Muses and not clearly separated from one another either in theory or in practice (and hence collectively referred to as mousikê).

- *My note [42]:* Yet another type of education to add to the list.

  

> *Page [43]:* Thus, the “history” of ancient Greek education is often narrated as a steady diachronic progression, from the “performance culture” of the Homeric/Archaic age, with its emphasis on bodily and musical achievement and self-presentation, to the intellectual and verbal focus of the first true schools and the Classical development of rhetoric and literary study—a progression, as Henri Marrou termed it, from the “noble warrior” to “the scribe” (Marrou 1956: xiv). This narrative has a sound logic to it, but it runs the risk of understating the continuities between the Archaic and Hellenistic periods and the continuing expectations of accomplished self-presentation in the gymnasium or school or courtroom and in oral (rather than written) performance that persisted throughout antiquity.

- *My note [43]:* Important to keep in mind.

  

#### 4. Literacy and Early Greek “Schools”–grammatistês, kitharistês, paidotribês

> *Page [47]:* Indeed, Greek has no regular word for “school” at this period: students are said to go “to the teacher’s” (eis didaskalou), “to the writing-teacher’s” (eis grammatistou), “to the lyre-teacher’s” (eis kitharistou), “to the trainer’s” (eis paidotribou), or else to the palaistra or gymnasion (e.g., Aristoph., Clouds 964, 973; Xen., Lac. Pol. 2–3, plato, Prot. 325e–326b).

- *My note [47]:* Said about early Greek schools. The Greek phrasing here is particularly interesting.

  

> *Page [48]:* A few educational theorists of the fourth century (notably plato, Laws Book 7 and Aristotle in his Politics) proposed that the city should subsidize schooling at all levels for all citizens; but there is no credible evidence that such legislation was ever passed anywhere, even in the Hellenistic period, though individual philanthropists did sometimes subsidize a local school (e.g., polythrous, in third C. bce Teos: SIG 3. 578; Ziebarth 1914: 54–59; Harris 1989: 96–102).

- *My note [48]:* This is pretty big. Make sure to look into Polythrous and check out Ziebarth and Harris.

  

#### 5. Conclusion: The Origins of “Classical” Education

> *Page [51]:* By this point, we have encountered many of the key components of the educational curriculum that came to be established by the mid-fourth century bce in Athens and elsewhere as the “classical” Greek—and eventually Roman—model: a combination of physical, verbal, and intellectual training, with an increasing focus on purity and correctness of linguistic usage (Hellenismos, Latinitas) and oral speech making; close attention to masculine deportment and self-presentation, particularly as institutionalized in the wrestling floor (palaistra) and exercise area (gymnasion)—or, for the Romans, the bathhouse—and the development of a canon of prime texts that every educated Greek and Roman should know and should be able to recite and discuss with some degree of authority.

- *My note [51]:* Perhaps a decent summary of the components of paideia?

  

> *Page [51]:* The great historian of Classical education, Henri Marrou, characterized the development of all the higher cultures of the ancient world as passing “from” a warrior culture to a scribal culture (Marrou 1956: xiv–xviii, 3–25, and passim). But, as we noted in Chapter 1, this does not accurately describe the societies of ancient Mesopotamia and Anatolia—in which the scribal culture was already highly developed by 2000 bce or earlier (see earlier text), but fairly separate from the activities of the ruling elites—nor does it adequately describe the developments of classical or even Hellenistic Greece. “Warrior” culture may indeed have been displaced onto mercenaries and centurions; but Greek and Roman elites for the most part never became “scribes.” They used written as well as spoken words; but most of them (despite the examples of, e.g., Thucydides and plato, Cicero and Seneca the Younger) sought to make their mark in the world as speakers and performers, not writers. Their “live” performances were the key to their social success or failure.

- *My note [51]:* I think this is a valid point.

> *Page [52-53]:* The imagined contrast between Greek toughness, inventiveness, and independence of spirit and “Asian” softness, conformism, and servility became a cliché (McCoskey 2012), as was the notion that this contrast was due both to nature (physis, including climate and geography) and to culture (nomos, including customs of training and performance for the young). Thus, the classical education came to see itself as training its students to be both manly and free, and also distinctively Greek (Gleason 1994)—and thus essentially different from the peoples of the rest of the world. For this, expertise in handwriting was not important (so, not a “scribal” culture); but control of one particular language (or for the Romans, two—both Greek and Latin), used in a particular way, along with a particular type of body and voice, were all required for the fullest development of a “free man.” Education in the “liberal arts” was now becoming systematized and institutionalized.
- *My note [52-53]:* I wonder how much νόμος was part of (or the force behind) Hellenistic education, particularly in the non-Greek areas of culture. Did this idea spread with the spread of Greek culture?

## Overall Thoughts
This chapter was especially helpful for providing context for the development of Greek education from its most obscure beginnings to something more fully developed (at the beginning of the Classical era). This chapter gave me more appreciation for Griffith. His previous chapter on education in the Ancient Near East was far too large in its scope and did very little historical analysis. It read something like a Wikipedia page rather than scholarship. This chapter, on the other hand, seems to cover a topic Griffith is actually well-versed in. In my opinion, he was the wrong person for the previous chapter, but a very reasonable choice on Bloomer's part for this chapter.
