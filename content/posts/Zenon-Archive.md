An archive of papyrus which relate to the figure of [[Zenon]]
Much of this archive were found by farmers in the area.

Unfortunately, the papyri are split up between several museums. 

Much of the papyri are receipts relating to the day-to-day running of the [[Apollonius (Dioiketes)]]' estate. 

From these documents we can tell that [[Apollonius (Dioiketes)|Apollonius]] was invested in his local [[Gymnasium]].
