An important note about the Hellenistic educational demotic content is that is is largely unpublished, according to Cribiore 2001. It is possible that more has been published since then, but I am also struggling to find more content. Nonetheless, Cribiore does say that the interaction between Greek and Demotic educational practices deserves further study.[^1]
