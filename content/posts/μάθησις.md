Here again, just like with [παιδεία](παιδεία.md) and [δίδαξις](δίδαξις.md), the distribution shows that the term is more prevalent in late antiquity. Perhaps it would be good to look into late antique education just to get a sense of what is going on and why there are so many references to the standard terms for education.
