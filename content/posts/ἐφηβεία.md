## Lexical Meaning


### As Described by Griffiths
> In fourth-century Athens, an elaborate institution of ephebeia (training for eighteen- to twenty-year-olds) is attested as a special kind of military service: the adolescents swore an oath of loyalty to the city; special officers were appointed (didaskaloi = “teachers,” sophronistês = “supervisor,” kosmêtês = “keeper-of-order”); they trained in light-armed weaponry, were subjected to endurance tests in the countryside, and assigned guard duties at border forts, before making their “passage” into full adulthood, i.e., becoming hoplites and voting citizens. The evidence consists primarily of twenty-eight Attic inscriptions dated between 334/3 and 322/1 BCE (cf. Tod (1948) #204), together with [Ar.] Ath. Pol. 42. But it is not clear how systematic the institution of ephebic military service had been in earlier centuries at Athens, nor whether other cities had similar systems.... By the third and second century, certainly, the Athenian ephebeia had become little more than a prep school for the wealthy (even including some non-Athenians), with gym and schoolrooms (Marrou 1956: 105–112). At this late date, it was no longer expected of every male citizen that he should be prepared at short notice to fight in the army; war was less common and was conducted increasingly by mercenaries.
