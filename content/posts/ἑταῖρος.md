## Lexical Meaning

### According to Griffith
> But it was among their adolescent and adult “comrades, buddies” (hetairoi), exercising during the daytime in the gymnasium or on military duty, and later in the afternoon/evening enjoying a shared dinner followed by wine drinking (symposion), as they reclined around the mixing bowl (kratêr) in a “men’s hall” (andrôn) or dining room of a private house, that adolescent boys learned the finer arts of sophisticated conversation, literary and musical analysis, eulogy and personal ridicule, sexual seduction and resistance, and stylish self-presentation. A man’s sympotic companions, together with his extended family, were likely to form the nucleus of his lifelong associates and political allies; and often they might train and fight alongside one another as well in the hoplite phalanx or cavalry. Any gathering of a “men’s group” might therefore double as a military and a social—and educational—occasion (Cartledge 1981; Murray 1990).
